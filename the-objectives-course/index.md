Hi. My name is [Pascal Laliberté](/) and I'm offering a course **about a trick I've learned: how to write objectives in a way I call _have-done lists_**.

## Here's what **_have-done lists_** look like:
{: .have-done-lists-heading }

<div class="have-done-lists" markdown="1">

<div class="have-done-list" markdown="1">
### Before the end of the morning, I'll have:

* Made sure everyone in the family started their day feeling good
* Written the next example for the course
  * Made a first draft of the evolution of the example's have-done list
  * Written the narrative surrounding the example's have-done list
* Done the 7-minute workout
</div>

<div class="have-done-list" markdown="1">
### Before the end of the meeting:

* ### I'll have:
  * Obtained a change in the way we work
    * Communicated my concern with the way it's working right now
    * Shared another alternative
* ### He'll have:
  * Obtained an authentic and frank discussion
  * Obtained a key player on the delivery of the new project
</div>

<div class="have-done-list" markdown="1">
### Before the end of the month, I'll have:

* Tended to the small tasks around the house
* Advanced in preparing for handling an emergency situation
  * Had a first fire drill that was clear, encouraged personal responsibility and was light-hearted
* Fixed the squeaky door to the garage
</div>
</div>

## From Catch-up <span class="br-xs"></span>to Catch-all

Maybe you're going through something like this right now:

* There's just **too many things to do** these days.
* **You have to catch-up** in too many areas of your life, and now it's gotten to be a little too much.
* It's gotten to a point where you realize that your **old habits are no longer working**. Your to-do system is no longer working, your decision system is no longer working, and the big picture needs fixing.

## From This-isn't-working to This-will-work

Or maybe your situation needs to change in deeper ways.

* You're faced with a complex problem and you need a way to advance on it
* You believe that there's a way to improve something, when others aren't so sure, or don't have the patience or energy to try.
* You want to reform an environment, starting with your own contribution to it.

***

### I've found that _have-done lists_ let me...

* **<mark>Start from scratch, by default</mark>**: Unlike to-do systems, have-done lists force me to treat today as the start of something new, not the continuation of yesterday's plan. That's freeing to me. I can peek into my past lists, but today's a new day, encouraging me to...
* **<mark>Picture "perfection"</mark>**: I like imagining the best way something can become, and _have-done lists_ encourage me to do that, while letting me...
* **<mark>Prioritize ruthlessly</mark>** to find the smallest possible, most impactful thing I can do first, which allow me to...
* **<mark>Have quick successes</mark>** that help me get to fun stuff later on, which help me...
* **<mark>Get away from the always-urgent</mark>** and closer to the important, less-urgent goals, which freed up my attention and energy to...
* **<mark>Tackle the most complex situations</mark>** and turn them around, in my family, in my work, with my friendships, where it matters, which, in the end, let me...
* **<mark>Care more</mark>** about [pretty much everything][godeepineverything] I usually care about, but especially about what is bigger, more important.

### I turn to _have-done lists_...

* *...instead of*{: .instead-of-prefix } **giving too much attention to urgent to-dos.** Have-done lists require you to _start with the end in mind_, forcing you to remove yourself from the urgency.
* *...instead of*{: .instead-of-prefix } **letting guilt accumulate** about things I'm not giving my attention to. Every day you can start fresh with a new list and make hard decisions about what's in and what's out. Beat the guilt!
* *...instead of*{: .instead-of-prefix } **writing to-do lists**, [because not everything that matters is a to-do](https://medium.com/@pascallaliberte/what-to-dos-cant-do-9e4568c7a901#.t9c97ucct). Sometimes what matters is to adopt a posture, or to listen, or to receive, or to connect. Have-done lists allow for those, no problem.
* *...instead of*{: .instead-of-prefix } **using different techniques for different time scales**. Have-done lists work on tiny time scales (_before my meeting with my boss, I'll have..._) as well as huge time scales (_before my kids leave for university, I'll have..._)
* *...instead of*{: .instead-of-prefix } **compromising on my vision**, since _there is a way_ to get the concrete stuff done while, _at the same time_, match my [vision/ideals of how things should be...](https://medium.com/@pascallaliberte/your-ideals-and-their-future-c0cd9966801c#.ci5yc7ss2)

## Structure of the course

The course will run over 10 weeks, starting on {{ site.course.starts }}.

**Every week, you'll receive an email** with an example situation (we'll pretend you're the person in the situation). We'll use _have-done lists_ to help write some objectives to get progress on that example situation. Here's an example [article which resembles how an example will be delivered](https://medium.com/@pascallaliberte/install-those-resolutions-962f7b52ac3b#.fwjhfv7px) in your email.

Week after week, example by example, you'll **unlearn what leads to the same results you used to have**, and you'll learn new ways to write objectives that get you what you really want. It'll be like **learning a new language**.

Also, with each email, I'll encourage you to share your objectives with me so I can give you feedback. Just reply back to share your own list, and I'll help you by **giving you quick ideas and suggestions to improve the way your objectives are written**.

{% if site.course.allow_signups %}
For the {{ site.course.starts }} course, I'll only take {{ site.course.limit }} people who I think I can most help, so be sure to apply before the deadline, Monday {{ site.course.deadline }}.

## Your _have-done_ lists for the course

<div class="have-done-list course-objectives" markdown="1">
### By the end of your first few weeks in the course, by putting in the effort, you will have:

* Started developing your own new _language_ for describing what you envision as a success
* Obtained a surprising result in one area of your life
* Realized, on a few occasions, how you used to tackle your problems, and how to improve your approach next times
</div>

<div class="have-done-list course-objectives" markdown="1">
### By the end of the course, after sticking with it, you will have:

* Noticed you had developed some new instincts when planning your next steps, that habits had formed
* Obtained a couple surprising results in unexpected areas of your life (personal, professional, family, friends)
* Felt satisfaction, on a few occasions, at having been able to picture "perfection" and having advanced a little toward it
* Developed a better appreciation of your natural tendencies and your default ways of tackling problems
* Been exposed to a variety of different ways to write objectives: time boxing, how to iterate on a list, new verbs to use at the beginning of each objective, how to group objectives, what questions to ask yourself to get unstuck, applying the technique on different time scales

## Testimonial

> "No need for any shiny new app, a perfect reference system or that new faster device to save some time -- all you need is your brain and heart in order to getting done what needs to be done and what you want to be done. But your mind needs to be rewired in order for that to work properly, and this course helps one to set sail on this journey of finding one's true objectives, life goals, desires and needs in relationships and the best way to prioritize handle all those mundane daily tasks as well. After those ten weeks you won’t be perfect and much work will still be needed - but you will be ready and armed with wisdom, advice and a better self-understanding in order to embark on your life’s journey with a renewed perspective and ambition."

### How it will work
{: .get-started-heading }

* The course starts on {{ site.course.starts }} with {{ site.course.limit }} people, coached individually.
* To be selected, sign up below and tell me about yourself, so we can see if we're a good match. After receiving your sign up, I'll contact you to learn more about you, and if we think the course will be helpful (and you're one of the first {{ site.course.limit }}), I'll send you a link to pay for the course via Paypal.
* Over 10 weeks, you'll receive weekly emails showing an example situation where _have-done lists_ are used to re-write the sample person's objectives. Through these examples, you'll learn by repetition some new ways to apply the ideas, and ways to write these objectives in a way that connects with your situation. I'll also encourage you to share with me your own lists, if you like, so I can give you specific feedback.
* To write your lists, any software tool that allows you to indent lines will do, but my tools of choice are [TaskPaper for Mac](https://taskpaper.com) and [Taskmator for iOS][taskmator] (here's an [article explaining how I use TaskPaper][taskpaperarticle])
* The price of the course is CAD ${{ site.course.price }} (plus HST if you're a resident of Ontario).
* If you're not happy with how the course is going for you, **I'll issue you a full refund** up to the last week of the course.

## A personal note

I've relied on this way of writing objectives for much of the breakthroughs I've had in the last long while. By visualizing a better situation, and focusing on the smallest thing I could do to improve the situation, I found some surprising ways to make things work out with less effort. I've managed some important small things, and I've navigated through some complex bigger things with these too. Put in the effort to re-write your options with these objectives lists, and you'll likely be surprised too.

If you've got some questions, look below for my email address.

Keep those ideals!  
Sincerely,
