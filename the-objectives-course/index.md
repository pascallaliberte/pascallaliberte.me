Hi. My name is [Pascal Laliberté](/) and, starting in the new year, I'll be offering a course **about a simple trick I've learned: how to write objectives in a way I call "have-done lists"**.

Here's what a have-done lists look like:

<div class="have-done-list" markdown="1">
Before the end of the evening, I'll have:
* Improved the text of the intro to the course
* Sent the new intro page to a couple friends for their feedback
* Advanced in preparing my objectives for what I'll have done before Christmas
* Got back to a friend about going to see Rogue One at the movies before the holiday break
</div>

<div class="have-done-list" markdown="1">
Before the end of the meeting:

I'll have:

* Obtained a change in the way we work
  * Communicated my concern with the way it's working right now
  * Shared another alternative

He'll have:

* Obtained an authentic and frank discussion
* Obtained a key player on the delivery of the new project
</div>

Before the end of the month, I'll have:

* Tended to the small tasks around the house
* Advanced in preparing for handling an emergency situation
  * Started preparing a fire drill that would be clear and easy to try out
* Fixed the squeaky door to the garage
</div>
</div>

I've been using this specific format of objective-writing for a few years...

* **Instead of**{: .instead-of-prefix } writing to-do lists (which I call "wish-for" lists);
* using more rigid frameworks like GTD or task-organization software (I now use TaskPaper for these lists);
* letting guilt accumulate about things I wasn't giving my attention to;
* giving too much attention to urgent to-dos;
* sitting still on important-but-not-urgent problems that needed to get tackled.
{: .instead-of-list }

And I've found that this format lets me...

* **Picture "perfection"**: I like imagining the best way something can become, and "have-done" lists encourage me to do that, while letting me...
* **Prioritize ruthlessly** to find the smallest possible, most impactful thing I can do first, which allow me to...
* **Have quick successes** that help me get to fun stuff later on, which help me...
* **Get away from the always-urgent** things and toward the important, less-urgent goals, which freed up my attention and energy to...
* **Change complex situations** I care about for the better, in my family, at work, with my friendship, and in my broader circle of influence.

## Structure of the course

The course will run over 10 weeks.

**Every week, you'll receive an email** from me with an example situation (we'll pretend you're the person in the situation). We'll use "have-done lists" to help write some objectives to get progress on that example situation.

Week after week, example by example, you'll **unlearn what leads to stale outcomes**, and you'll learn new ways to write objectives that get you what you really want. It'll be like **learning a new language**.

Also, with each email, I'll encourage you to share what you have with me so I can give you feedback. Just reply back to share your own list, and I'll help you by **giving you quick ideas and suggestions to improve what you have**.

### By the end of your first few weeks in the course, by putting in the effort, you'll have:

* Started developing your own new _language_ for describing what you envision as a success;
* Obtained a surprising result in one area of your life.
* Felt on a few occasions that you understood in a unique way how you used to tackle your problems, and how to improve your approach next times
</div>

### By the end of the course, after sticking with it, you will have:

* Noticed you had developed some new instincts when planning your next steps, that habits had formed;
* Obtained a couple surprising results in unexpected areas of your life (personal, professional, family, friends);
* Felt satisfaction on a few occasions at having been able to picture "perfection" and having advanced a little toward it;
* Developed a better appreciation of your natural tendencies and your default ways of tackling problems
* More concretely, you'll have been exposed to a variety of different ways to write objectives: time boxing, how to iterate on a list, a set of good verbs to use at the beginning of each objective, how to group objectives, what questions to ask yourself to get unstuck, applying the technique on different time scales.
