# The Objectives Course

<div class="intro" markdown="1">
**A 10-week course on writing _have-done_ lists: a way to write objectives that surprisingly helps you explore possibilities, visualize and get to _done_ on the big and the small in your life.**

It'll start in the new year, with a group of 5 people to start, with examples and individual coaching all done over email.

Hi. My name is [Pascal Laliberté](/) and, starting in the new year, I'll be offering a course **about a simple trick I've learned: how to write objectives in a way I call _have-done lists_**.

## Here's what **_have-done lists_** look like:
{: .have-done-lists-heading }

<div class="have-done-lists" markdown="1">

<div class="have-done-list" markdown="1">
### Before the end of the evening, I'll have:

* Improved the text of the intro to the course
* Sent the new intro page to a couple friends for their feedback
* Advanced in preparing my objectives for what I'll have done before Christmas
* Got back to a friend about going to see Rogue One at the movies before the holiday break
</div>

<div class="have-done-list" markdown="1">
### Before the end of the meeting:

* ### I'll have:
  * Obtained a change in the way we work
    * Communicated my concern with the way it's working right now
    * Shared another alternative
* ### He'll have:
  * Obtained an authentic and frank discussion
  * Obtained a key player on the delivery of the new project
</div>

<div class="have-done-list" markdown="1">
### Before the end of the month, I'll have:

* Tended to the small tasks around the house
* Advanced in preparing for handling an emergency situation
  * Had a first fire drill that was clear, encouraged personal responsibility and was light-hearted
* Fixed the squeaky door to the garage
</div>
</div>

I've been using this specific format of objective-writing for a few years...

* *Instead of*{: .instead-of-prefix } **letting guilt accumulate** about things I wasn't giving my attention to
* *Instead of*{: .instead-of-prefix } **using more rigid frameworks** like GTD or task-organization software (I now use [TaskPaper](https://taskpaper.com) with [a custom-made theme](https://github.com/pascallaliberte/theme-notes-first) for writing have-done lists)
* *Instead of*{: .instead-of-prefix } **giving too much attention to urgent to-dos.** Have-done lists require you to "Start with the end in mind" habit, forcing you to remove yourself from the urgency for more perspective
* *Instead of*{: .instead-of-prefix } **sitting still on important-but-not-urgent problems** that needed to get tackled
* *Instead of*{: .instead-of-prefix } **writing to-do lists**, because not everything that matters is a to-do. Sometimes what matters is to adopt a posture, or to listen, or to receive, or to connect. Have-done lists allow for those, no problem
* *Instead of*{: .instead-of-prefix } **using different techniques for different time scales**. Have-done lists work on tiny time scales (_before my meeting with my boss, I'll have..._) as well as huge time scales (_before my kids leave for university, I'll have..._)
* *Instead of*{: .instead-of-prefix } **compromising on my vision**, since there is _a way_ to get the concrete stuff done while, _at the same time_, match my vision of how things should be...
{: .instead-of-list }

And I've found that this format lets me...

* **Picture "perfection"**: I like imagining the best way something can become, and _have-done lists_ encourage me to do that, while letting me...
* **Prioritize ruthlessly** to find the smallest possible, most impactful thing I can do first, which allow me to...
* **Have quick successes** that help me get to fun stuff later on, which help me...
* **Get away from the always-urgent** things and toward the important, less-urgent goals, which freed up my attention and energy to...
* **Tackle the most complex situations** and turn them around, in my family, in my work, with my friendships, where it matters.

## Structure of the course

The course will run over 10 weeks.

**Every week, you'll receive an email** from me with an example situation (we'll pretend you're the person in the situation). We'll use _have-done lists_ to help write some objectives to get progress on that example situation.

Week after week, example by example, you'll **unlearn what leads to stale outcomes**, and you'll learn new ways to write objectives that get you what you really want. It'll be like **learning a new language**.

Also, with each email, I'll encourage you to share what you have with me so I can give you feedback. Just reply back to share your own list, and I'll help you by **giving you quick ideas and suggestions to improve what you have**.

## Your _have-done_ lists for the course

<div class="have-done-list course-objectives" markdown="1">
### By the end of your first few weeks in the course, by putting in the effort, you will have:

* Started developing your own new _language_ for describing what you envision as a success
* Obtained a surprising result in one area of your life
* Realized, on a few occasions, how you used to tackle your problems, and how to improve your approach next times
</div>

<div class="have-done-list course-objectives" markdown="1">
### By the end of the course, after sticking with it, you will have:

* Noticed you had developed some new instincts when planning your next steps, that habits had formed
* Obtained a couple surprising results in unexpected areas of your life (personal, professional, family, friends)
* Felt satisfaction, on a few occasions, at having been able to picture "perfection" and having advanced a little toward it
* Developed a better appreciation of your natural tendencies and your default ways of tackling problems
* **More concretely**, you'll have been exposed to a variety of different ways to write objectives: time boxing, how to iterate on a list, new verbs to use at the beginning of each objective, how to group objectives, what questions to ask yourself to get unstuck, applying the technique on different time scales
