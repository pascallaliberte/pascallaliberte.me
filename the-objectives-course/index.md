# The Objectives Course

Welcome to the Objectives course. You're in the right place if you feel like you can't find a way to organize your life in a way where you can be yourself: you like to think of all the options, you like to drill down to bottom of things, and having to opt for _simple_ todo list systems leaves you paralyzed. That sense that you can't find a way to get all that in a package might even leave you angry.

By the end of the course, you'll have:

* Gained experience writing objectives in a way that tricks your brain in getting success, almost always.
* Started creating in your mind some new instincts, some new go-to questions you ask yourself, some new angles from which to look at a tough problem.
* Felt equipped to handle complex situations that are coming up, or that you're going through
* Obtained a success in one important area of your life. You might even have felt like it was a breakthrough

This is a course that'll be taking place over many months, and will cost a multiple of a hundred dollars. If this is a problem from the start, then maybe you'd like to just [learn the basics, for free, right here][freebasics]. There is no secret to the techniques, and I share them freely. What you get with the course is practice. You also get exposure to my coaching and feedback, like an apprenticeship. Over the months, you'll get to unlearn things that don't help, and you'll get to learn the subtleties of the things that do work.

So how will it work, exactly?

Every week, and sometimes more than once a week (e.g. the first week), you'll get a use case in the email. An example of a problem, the situation, a shot at solving it, explanations on how that first attempt doesn't quite work, and iterations on an objectives document to help you find the way to solve it, for real.

So it'll all be done over emails. Each time, I'll invite you to share your reactions, your own document you're working on, and I'll give you quick feedback, sometimes in the hour you send me your feedback. I'm taking just a few folks at a time with the course, that's so I can give you the proper attention.
