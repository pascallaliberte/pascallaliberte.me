## How I can help

### Jobs-To-Be-Done Interviews

To find out what jobs your existing buyers are hiring your product for, here's one way to do it. We find 10 people who recently bought your product, we find out if they're a good match to be interviewed.

Each interview is about 50 minutes long, and we ask the buyer to recount the story of the purchase. We then analyze the findings, and come up with a plan to test some changes in the product's marketing.
