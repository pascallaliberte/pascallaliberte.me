Can I ask you some questions about your recent sign-up to The Focus Course?

I'm [Pascal Laliberté](#about) and I'm researching what drives people to make investments in their personal growth.

I'm not affiliated with Shawn Blanc and haven't taken The Focus Course, but if you've recently paid for the course (in the last 3 months), could I ask you some questions?

## **Do these match your situation?**

* You purchased The Focus Course **in the last 90 days** (either the Basic, Premium or All Access package)
*  It took you **some time to think it over**, to make up your mind to make the purchase
*  You **bought the course for yourself** (not as a gift for someone)

Do you match all three points? Can I call you to ask you about the purchase? It'll be a **one-hour call**, and for your time, I'll be sending you a $50 Amazon Gift Certificate.

Interested? Here are 4 questions to get started and I'll be in touch.

## Q & A

### Q. Can you tell me more about yourself?
{: #about }

I'm [Pascal Laliberté](/), and I live in Ottawa, Canada. I do app and web design and development, and I'm generally interested in deep subjects like personal growth, getting to the bottom of things, understanding how things work. These days, my focus is on mental models, post-heroism, and mental reprogramming.

### Q. Why are you interested in knowing about my experience with The Focus Course?

There's this buyer psychology theory called Jobs-To-Be-Done. It's been formulated by Harvard School of Business professor Clayton Christensen, and it basically says that people don't buy products, they hire products for a job. I have ideas for creating personal growth-type products, and want to generally find the jobs for which people hire personal growth-type products. The interview will use an approach based on the ideas behind the theory (I'll ask you to tell me about the situations preceding your purchase -- you share with me what you'd like to share).

### Q. Will you share details about my situation with others?

If there's an insight into your situation, it would be useful for others to hear about it! But, I won't share your name or anything that'll identify you.

### Q. What if I'm just considering buying The Focus Course, but haven't bought it yet?

I'm focusing my research on those who made a purchase of a personal growth-type product (it could be a course or a service, a coaching session, a book, etc). If you've made such a purchase for another product, maybe [I'd love to interview you about that other purchase instead](../).

### Q. What books are you reading these days?

* _Competing Against Luck_ by Clayton Christensen -- The Jobs-To-Be-Done theory removes luck from the process of putting a product on the market.
* _Purple Cow_ by Seth Godin -- Build a product to be remarkable, from its inception.
* _So Good They Can't Ignore You_ by Cal Newport -- Build career capital before making a move.
* _Peak Performance_ by Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness -- Currently reading, but so far: Growth = Stress + Rest, and the importance of deliberate practice.
* _Blue-Ocean Strategy_, by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne. Currently reading, but so far: there's an abundance of business ideas.

I've talked about mental models a few questions up. The book I want to read about that is _Leadership Agility_ by Bill Joiner. If you're interested in reading it together in a reading group setup, give me a shout: I'm @pascallaliberte or send me an email at pascal at this domain.

### Q. I'm at the bottom of the page, can I get a link back up to the form?
