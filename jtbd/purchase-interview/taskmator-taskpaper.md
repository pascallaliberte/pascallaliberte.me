# {{ page.title }}

Hi. [Pascal](/) here, thanks for dropping by.

I'm interested in hearing the story of your [Taskmator][taskmator] or your [TaskPaper][taskpaper] purchase. I'm doing some background research on buying habits and I'm interested in understanding about people's purchases, especially of their purchase of apps like Taskmator or TaskPaper.

[taskmator]: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/taskmator-taskpaper-client/id806250172?mt=8
[taskpaper]: https://www.taskpaper.com

## **Do these match your experience?**

- You purchased Taskmator or TaskPaper (or both) **in the last 90 days**
- It took you **some time to think it over**, to make up your mind to make the purchase. It wasn't an instant purchase.
- You bought it **for yourself** (not a gift)
{: .get-started-checklist }

Does your purchase match every point in the checklist? Can I call you to ask you about the purchase? It'll be a **one-hour call**.

If so, please select a time where you're available for a call and I'll call you. Super grateful!

## **Q: Will you share the information publicly?**

I won't share information about you publicly, but if you agree, I'll share a recording of our interview (and my notes) with Amit, the maker of Taskmator, or Jesse Grosjean, the maker of TaskPaper, so he can learn from your buying experience. Only if you agree! I might also tell elements of your story in a blog post, without naming names or sharing anything that would identify you. I'd do that to help others understand about what helps someone make a purchase decision.

## **Q: Is there enough to talk about to last a one-hour phone call?**

Yes! I'll be asking questions that will sound a little like as if I'm making a movie recreating your purchase story. Time will go fast. And normally we cover everything in about 50 minutes.

## **Q: Do you use Taskmator or TaskPaper yourself?**

Yes! I've used both Taskmator and TaskPaper since forever. See these two articles on **how I use TaskPaper**: [_Objectives, not Todos_][article1], and [_Mental Reprogramming Ahead of Complex Situations_][article2]
