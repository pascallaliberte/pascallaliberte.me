Hi. [Pascal](/) here, thanks for dropping by.

I'm interested in hearing people's stories of how they made a recent purchase. Can you help? For an hour of your time, you'll receive a $50 Amazon gift card after the interview.

## **Do these match your experience?**

- You purchased something **in the last 90 days**
- It took you **some time to think it over**, to make up your mind to make the purchase
- It was something you **bought for yourself** (not a gift)
- It was a **first-time purchase** (not a refill)
- It was a **sizable price**, like $100 or more, roughly.

Does your purchase match every point in the checklist? Can I call you to ask you about the purchase? It'll be a **one-hour call**, and you'll get a $50 Amazon gift card after the interview.

If so, please select a time where you're available for a call and I'll call you. Super grateful.
