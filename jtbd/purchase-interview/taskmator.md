# {{ page.title }}

Hi. [Pascal](/) here, thanks for dropping by.

I'm interested in hearing the story of your [Taskmator][taskmator] purchase. I'm doing some background research on buying habits and I'm interested in understanding about people's purchase of an app like Taskmator.

[taskmator]: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/taskmator-taskpaper-client/id806250172?mt=8

## **Do these match your experience?**

- You purchased Taskmator **in the last 90 days**
- It took you **some time to think it over**, to make up your mind to make the purchase. It wasn't an instant purchase.
- You bought it **for yourself** (not a gift)
{: .get-started-checklist }

Does your purchase match every point in the checklist? Can I call you to ask you about the purchase? It'll be a **one-hour call**.

If so, please select a time where you're available for a call and I'll call you. Super grateful!

## **Q: Will you share the information publicly?**

I won't share information about you publicly, but if you agree, I'll share a recording of our interview (and my notes) with Amit, the maker of Taskmator, so he can learn from your buying experience. Only if you agree. I might also tell elements of your story in a blog post, without naming names or sharing anything that would identify you. I'd do that to help others understand about what helps someone make a purchase decision.

## **Q: Is there enough to talk about to last a one-hour phone call?**

Yes! I'll be asking questions that will sound a little like as if I'm making a movie recreating your purchase story. Time will go fast. And normally we cover everything in about 50 minutes.

## **Q: Do you use Taskmator yourself?**

Yes! I've used Taskmator since forever. And I use TaskPaper on the Mac as well. See these two articles on how I use TaskPaper. [_Objectives, not Todos_][article1], and [Mental Reprogramming Ahead of Complex Situations][article2]
