## Learn on your own

There are two mental reprogramming techniques I've used:
{: .text-center }

<div class="clearfix" markdown="1">
<div class="left" markdown="1">
### 1. Have-done lists

Pretend you're in the future, that's the trick of have-done lists. Replace to-dos with this "Language of Objectives"

<div class="taskpaper" markdown="1">
### Before the end of the my conversation with my boss:

* ### I'll have:
  * Obtained a change in the way we work
    * Communicated my concern with the way it's working right now
    * Shared another alternative
* ### She'll have:
  * Obtained an authentic and frank discussion
  * Obtained a key player on the delivery of the new project
</div>

</div>

<div class="right" markdown="1">
### 2. Mental models

Detect the mental models that warp your ability to see reality, and catch them before you go off on the wrong course.

<div class="taskpaper" markdown="1">
### What am I so sure about?

* Unless things change, it'll go bad
  * {: .highlight }Maybe
* If I propose a change, she'll be defensive
  * {: .highlight }If I make the vulnerable first step, I might learn something
* Surely, my manager has thought of the problem already
  * {: .highlight }Maybe she did
  * {: .highlight }Maybe she wasn't ready to talk about it because she had no solution
</div>

</div>

</div>

## Both of these techniques are described in this video:

### Video: Use Mental Reprogramming (on Yourself) to Change (Pretty Much) Any Situation.

Three situations that are covered:

* Sarah works on her consulting business today, and she’s got a full plate (too much to do!).
* Dan is sure his supervisor won’t agree to his idea.
* Sylvie’s meeting with partners on an important project is going nowhere.

## Or you can take the course:

[The Language of Objectives](/language-of-objectives/) is a 10-week course on learning have-done lists. Every week, get an email with an example situation improved by using have-done lists, and get coaching on your own lists via email by me. By the mid-way point, by putting in the effort, you'll have obtained a breakthrough in one area of your life. The next round starts on {{ site.course.starts }}.

## Or Let's Start with a Coaching Call

At the end of this 45-minute call, you'll have:

* Obtained confirmation about your options
* Obtained ideas about other approaches
* Obtained a listening ear

## About me

My name is [Pascal](/). I've developed these techniques so that I could use my natural preferences to go big-picture and small-picture at the same, to strive for doing the right thing, and to think of every variable. Since then, I've improved situations in my life that left me surprised. Sometimes, all that is needed is to adopt the right posture, finding the smallest thing that'll do the biggest impact, and changing our mindsets. I hope I can help you with your situations too.
