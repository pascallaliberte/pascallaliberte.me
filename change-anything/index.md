Hi, I'm [Pascal](/). I've been using two main mental tools to help me navigate complex situations. They'll be useful to you if you like to be thorough, you persist in getting to the bottom of things, and you want to do the right thing.
{: .highlight }

## Two mental tools

<div class="clearfix" markdown="1">
<div class="left" markdown="1">
### 1. Have-done lists

Pretend you're in the future, that's the trick of have-done lists. Replace to-dos with this "Language of Objectives"

<div class="taskpaper" markdown="1">
### Before the end of the my conversation with my boss:

* ### I'll have:
  * Obtained a change in the way we work
    * Communicated my concern with the way it's working right now
    * Shared another alternative
* ### She'll have:
  * Obtained an authentic and frank discussion
  * Obtained a key player on the delivery of the new project
</div>

</div>

<div class="right" markdown="1">
### 2. Mental models

Stay on the right path by catching and rewriting your thoughts before they take over.

<div class="taskpaper" markdown="1">
### What am I so sure about?

* Unless things change, it'll go bad
  * {: .highlight }Maybe
* If I propose a change, she'll be defensive
  * {: .highlight }If I make the vulnerable first step, I might learn something
* Surely, my manager has thought of the problem already
  * {: .highlight }Maybe she did
  * {: .highlight }Maybe she wasn't ready to talk about it because she had no solution

## To change pretty much any situation

<div class="examples" markdown="1">

* One person **prepares a conversation** with her supervisor for proposing a change in the way things are done.
* One person creates a difficult but important document to **sell an idea**.
* Another person **redefines a relationship with a co-worker in a deep way**, and creates a partnership that's going to be key to doing the next big thing.
* A person makes a **tiny change in their posture** ahead of talking to the group, and the impact is remarked by others.
* Another person was asked to do something consequential and important, but is **paralyzed with doubt** about her capabilities.
* Another person is **furious about the work of a team member**, and she prepares for the best way to make this into a good situation for both of you (and others).
* One person sees that a **change in the team's processes** is important, and she envisions the next month and her approach to bring that new approach in.
* A person senses some **cynicism installing itself** in the mind of people of the group. She knows the cause, and she feels urged to fix it before it gets out of hand.
* Another person is reading about change management, but realizes the biggest impact she can have, is to **be a person people can be comfortable being authentic to**.
