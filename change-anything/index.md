Hi, I'm [Pascal](/). I've been using two main mental reprogramming tools to help me navigate complex situations. They'll be useful to you if you like to be thorough, you persist in getting to the bottom of things, and you want to do the right thing. If it's on you to change the situation for the better, than you want to be sure your mind isn't what's in the way. **Change happens first in the mind**.

## Two Mental Reprogramming Tools

<div class="clearfix" markdown="1">
<div class="left" markdown="1">
### 1. Have-done lists

Pretend you're in the future, that's the trick of have-done lists. Replace to-dos with this "Language of Objectives"

<div class="taskpaper" markdown="1">
### Before the end of the my conversation with my boss:

* ### I'll have:
  * Obtained a change in the way we work
    * Communicated my concern with the way it's working right now
    * Shared another alternative
* ### She'll have:
  * Obtained an authentic and frank discussion
  * Obtained a key player on the delivery of the new project
</div>

</div>

<div class="right" markdown="1">
### 2. Mental models

Stay on the right path by catching and rewriting your thoughts before they take over.

<div class="taskpaper" markdown="1">
### What am I so sure about?

* Unless things change, it'll go bad
  * {: .highlight }Maybe
* If I propose a change, she'll be defensive
  * {: .highlight }If I make the vulnerable first step, I might learn something
* Surely, my manager has thought of the problem already
  * {: .highlight }Maybe she did
  * {: .highlight }Maybe she wasn't ready to talk about it because she had no solution

## To change pretty much any situation

<div class="examples" markdown="1">

* You see a problem in the way your team works and you need to have that changed.
* It's important that you get a client to see things from a new perspective.
* You discovered something about your son that needs addressing.
* There's a big opportunity coming up that you don't want to miss on.
* Suddenly, all your priorities no longer matter. That big event changed everything, and you need to take it slow, do it right.
* There's a deadline coming up and you're paralyzed by analysis.
* You see everything that's wrong everywhere, and you're overwhelmed. Something's got to change.
* There's an injustice at work, and you're feeling the urge to step up.
* In your family, you see a bad relationship trend and you sense that it needs to be broached.
* In the past, you used to know the right way to do things. Now, it's important you give the space for others to learn and you want to change your behaviours.
* There's an urgent need to help a friend, but your relationship had some difficulties. It's time to let those bad feelings aside and be helpful.
* You're hesitant how to take on something you've never tried before, but nobody else is going to do it, so it's up to you this time.
* You need to prepare for a difficult but important conversation with your boss.
* You see something new that needs to be created, but you're paralyzed with doubt.
* You're starting a new consultancy, and you want to have a good first day.
* You're furious about a team member's performance, and you need to prepare your conversation so there's a good outcome for the both of you and the rest of the team.
* You see that cynicism is installing itself in the team, and you know the problem has to be fixed at the source.
* You find it difficult to be authentic and vulnerable, but this time it'll be important that you put on those traits, and you want to be ready.
