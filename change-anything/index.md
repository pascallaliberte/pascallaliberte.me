{: #page-title }

Do you like to be thorough and do things right? Is there something important in your life that you want to change? In the recent years, I've developed a method that helps me attain pretty much any goal. With two mental reprogramming tools ([have-done lists and mental models, more on them below](#the-kit)), I take hold of my thoughts, analyze them and put them in the right order. It's actually become a way of life and the results are fantastic!

## To change pretty much any situation

<div class="examples" markdown="1">

* You see that cynicism is installing itself in the team, and you know the problem has to be fixed at the source.
* In your family, you see a bad relationship trend and you sense that it needs to be broached.
* There's a big opportunity coming up that you don't want to miss on.
* In the past, you used to know the right way to do things. Now, it's important you give the space for others to learn and you want to change your behaviours.

**Show more situations**

<!-- * You're hesitant how to take on something you've never tried before, but nobody else is going to do it, so it's up to you this time.
* You see a problem in the way your team works and you need to have that changed.
* It's important that you get a client to see things from a new perspective.
* There's an injustice at work, and you're feeling the urge to step up.
* There's a deadline coming up and you're paralyzed by analysis.
* You see everything that's wrong everywhere, and you're overwhelmed. Something's got to change.
* Suddenly, all your priorities no longer matter. That big event changed everything, and you need to take it slow, do it right.
* There's an urgent need to help a friend, but your relationship had some difficulties. It's time to let those bad feelings aside and be helpful.
* You need to prepare for a difficult but important conversation with your boss.
* You discovered something about your son that needs addressing.
* You see something new that needs to be created, but you're paralyzed with doubt.
* You're starting a new consultancy, and you want to have a good first day.
* You're furious about a team member's performance, and you need to prepare your conversation so there's a good outcome for the both of you and the rest of the team.
* You find it difficult to be authentic and vulnerable, but this time it'll be important that you put on those traits, and you want to be ready. -->

## The two Mental Reprogramming Tools

<div class="clearfix" markdown="1">
<div class="left" markdown="1">
### 1. Have-done lists

Pretend you're in the future, that's the trick of have-done lists. Replace to-dos with this "Language of Objectives"

<div class="taskpaper" markdown="1">
### Before the end of the my conversation with my boss:

* ### I'll have:
  * Obtained a change in the way we work
    * Communicated my concern with the way it's working right now
    * Shared another alternative
* ### She'll have:
  * Obtained an authentic and frank discussion
  * Obtained a key player on the delivery of the new project
</div>

</div>

<div class="right" markdown="1">
### 2. Mental models

Stay on the right path by catching and rewriting your thoughts before they take over.

<div class="taskpaper" markdown="1">
### What am I so sure about?

* Unless things change, it'll go bad
  * {: .highlight }Maybe
* If I propose a change, she'll be defensive
  * {: .highlight }If I make the vulnerable first step, I might learn something
* Surely, my manager has thought of the problem already
  * {: .highlight }Maybe she did
  * {: .highlight }Maybe she wasn't ready to talk about it because she had no solution
