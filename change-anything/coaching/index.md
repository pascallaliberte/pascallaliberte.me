## My approach

Although the coaching call is mostly about helping find ideas you already have, here's a little about my own approach to changing complicated or important situations.

I've used two techniques that I now qualify as mental reprogramming techniques. 

The two techniques: have-done lists and mental models. You can learn about them on your own if you'd like from this other page, but you don't need to know about them for the coaching call to help with your situation.

They're helpful if you want to catch your thoughts (and rewrite them) before they take over, or if you want to organize your intentions so you get to the bottom of what you're trying to do. It's a little like learning a new language at the start, but once you know the language, you're able to use it to change your perspective on things.

## To help you with situations like these:

* There's a big opportunity coming up that you don't want to miss on.
* There's a deadline coming up and you're paralyzed by analysis.
* There's an urgent need to help a friend, but your relationship had some difficulties. It's time to let those bad feelings aside and be helpful.
* You discovered something about your son that needs addressing.
* You're furious about a team member's performance, and you need to prepare your conversation so there's a good outcome for the both of you and the rest of the team.
* You need to prepare for a difficult but important conversation with your boss.
* You find it difficult to be authentic and vulnerable, but this time it'll be important that you put on those traits, and you want to be ready.
* You see a problem in the way your team works and you need to have that changed.
* You see something new that needs to be created, but you're paralyzed with doubt.
* In your family, you see a bad relationship trend and you sense that it needs to be broached.
* You're hesitant how to take on something you've never tried before, but nobody else is going to do it, so it's up to you this time.
