## My approach

**The coaching call will be mostly about helping find ideas you already have, making progress with what you know. You'll know there's a good fit if you're interested in getting to the bottom of things, if you value thoughtfulness and if you value doing the right thing.**

If it's helpful, here's a little about my own approach to changing complicated or important situations. I use these two mental reprogramming techniques: have-done lists and mental models. They're helpful if you want to catch your thoughts (and rewrite them) before they take over, or if you want to organize your intentions so you get to the bottom of what you're trying to do. It's a little like learning a new language at the start, but once you know the language, you're able to use it to change your perspective on things. You can [learn about them on this other page][learn].

## To help you with <mark>more timely situations</mark> like these:

<div markdown="1" class="examples">

* There's a <mark>big opportunity coming up</mark> that you don't want to miss on.
* There's a <mark>deadline coming up</mark> and you're paralyzed by analysis.
* There's an urgent need to help a friend, but <mark>your relationship had some difficulties.</mark> It's time to let those bad feelings aside and be helpful.
* You <mark>discovered something about your son</mark> that needs addressing.
* You're <mark>furious about a team member's performance,</mark> and you need to prepare your conversation so there's a good outcome for the both of you and the rest of the team.
* You need to prepare for a <mark>difficult but important conversation with your boss.</mark>
* You find it <mark>difficult to be authentic and vulnerable,</mark> but this time it'll be important that you put on those traits, and you want to be ready.
* You see a problem in the way your team works and <mark>you need to have that changed.</mark>
* You see something new that needs to be created, but <mark>you're paralyzed with doubt.</mark>
* In your family, you see a <mark>bad relationship trend</mark> and you sense that it needs to be broached.
* You're hesitant how to <mark>take on something you've never tried before,</mark> but nobody else is going to do it, so it's up to you this time.

## About me
{: #about }

I'm [Pascal](/). I've always been the type to want to inventory every variable, think of every option before making a decision, being intentional about my choices.

Many times, that has paralyzed me, and I felt those tendencies were for me a fault. As I found my own ways to organize my to-dos and next steps, I realized I can use my tendencies to inventory everything and my yearning to go deep on everything as a bonus. That's been the engine that got me to come up with have-done lists.

I've also taken a leadership course where I learned about mental models, which helped me remove my ego from the choices I made, be less reactive and more constructive when dealt with confining situations.

I've developed the skills of empathy and of listening, and so I hope I can be helpful with your situation through a [coaching call][coaching] (above) or [through the techniques I've learned][learn]. Glad to help.
