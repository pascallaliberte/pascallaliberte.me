Hello,

I'm **Pascal Laliberté**. Thanks for dropping by.

I work at the University of Ottawa's Faculty of Medicine, doing e-learning. My background is in design, web development, and personal development too.

Learn.med is the Faculty of Medicine's online learning platform. It offers short online courses for practicing physicians to better their knowledge and get credits, for medical residents, and for students working to get their medical degree. We use xAPI to power our learning analytics and we've built a simple LMS to house our courses.

On my own time, I offer a service called Popup LMS. It's a simple way to get a few courses and quizzes online, and get detailed and customized reports on the progress of your learners. For a fixed price and for a run of a few months, everything is taken care of: you'll know your course is getting followed, and your learners will be delighted at how smooth the experience was. No fuss, no fluff, no headache. If you have a place for your course but you just want custom reporting from xAPI and from an LRS, I can do that for you too. Get in touch.

Before getting into e-learning, I started by doing web work, doing front-end programming, information design, user interface design, building sites and apps and doing customer support. Caring for the user is central to my work. And here's what else I care about:

I value depth of thought, intention, getting to the bottom of things and doing the right thing.

I value starting small, iterating, doing what matters, betting on the long-haul and respecting the natural rhythm of things.

In relationships, I value authenticity, complicity, openness and truth.

And I value surpassing myself, taking the lead and tending to others.

In this care for growth and relationships and depth, I'm drawn to Christianity. Deeply skeptical, I believe. Learning to bridge modernity and faith has been good for me, and I believe there's no higher urgency for my fellow christians to do the same. And so I write a blog on [Leading a modern life while living the Gospel][faithblog], sharing the ways I see in achieving both, fully. Let's all grow towards more maturity, and to a more subtle faith. Here's the list of articles:

Before you go, here are some questions for you. I pose myself these questions regularly, which help me stay true, and help me make good choices. I hope they're useful to you too:

* What are you so convinced of? Any time you feel conflicted, agitated, or out of options, inspect and identify your [mental models, those invisible lenses through which we distort how we see reality][mentalmodels]. Make it a habit to put your finger on them.
* What are you going to be celebrating? Before a date not too far into the future, what's the one thing you will be able to say you'll have done, and none of the others, to be celebrating? And then what would be the second from that list, and the third. I call these [have-done lists][havedonelists], and I find these essential to giving my best decisions my best shot.
