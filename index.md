## My work: <span class="sub-title">Custom Wordpress Component Developer for Web Agencies</span>

**If you're a web agency** looking to win a design, and there's a **custom page component you'd like to have built for a WordPress site**, I can help you plan it and I can take charge of building a really nice one for your project.

<div class="home-component-examples" markdown="1">
### Example components you might be looking to have built for your WordPress site:

* A custom-designed map, fed by custom locations;
* A nice, fast filtered list, that updates without the whole page reloading. Like a staff directory, a long list of projects, or any type of directory;
* Animations and some nice custom transitions when you get to a point in the page;
* A custom audio player for a podcast, for some sample tunes or for sound bytes;
* A data-backed infographic, pulling data from your a back-end;
* A custom multi-step registration process, or;
* A hand-styled form that prefills based on interactions on the page.
</div>

I can make your component **work with your page builder of choice**, make it load via adding a custom shortcode, **built as an ACF Pro Flex module** or made to work as a block for the Gutenberg editor.

I'll build you a **fast-loading, responsive and adaptable component** either using custom Vue.js, vanilla javascript when it does the job, or styling existing Wordpress plugins if that's more appropriate. It'll work with the right browsers and devices and for different connection speeds.

**For a look into my work**, check out this [video on using Roots for Wordpress Development][roots-presentation], this [demo of using Vue.js with Turbolinks][vue-turbolinks-demo] or this [demo of using Stimulus with Turbolinks][stimulus-turbolinks-demo].

**[Drop me a note](mailto:pascal@pascallaliberte.me)** if you'd like to chat about the nice design you'd like to get to. Please include some details on the project, the type of component you're looking to have built, and some constraints like a rough deadline and the WordPress tools you plan on using. I'll reply with more questions and a link to my schedule for a first call.

## Ideas

* Design is best when done in tandem with the implementation. Knowing the limits of the material you work with makes for a better design.
* There's a particular urgency to [surpass ourselves and to become mature about our choices][postheroism], so that we know how to handle the fast pace of life.
* Most times when we hit an either/or mindset, there's usually a third way.
* We're complicated people, and we're full of paradoxes. Learning to [bridge those paradoxes helps us be better with others][bridgeparadoxes].
* There's a way to [achieve multiple things at once][godeepineverything], so long as you ruthlessly put things in the right order. That way, the first thing will feed into the second one and into the third, and all the way down, letting you achieve them all.
* To-do lists are only a little helpful, because they're usually written as wish-for lists. I found that [writing have-done lists][havedone] to be the most helpful kind of list to write.

## Areas of interest

My main areas of interest are:

* **The *Jobs-To-Be-Done* theory**, which is on what causes people to purchase a product; Find out more at [Sharpen.page - A Product Sharpening Service][sharpen-page]
* **Maturity in Leadership and _post-heroism_.** Great managers are rare, and the way to get there is to develop the ability to tame our ego and by detecting when we mental models affecting our judgement. Find out more at [The Change Anything Kit](/change-anything/)
* **Writing software in a modest way.** By starting small and using the best of the modern approaches, we can write good software without playing the game every one else plays in the software industry.

**When building products, I use these technologies:** For crafting web interfaces, I've been really liking [Stimulus (see a presentation I gave)][stimulusjs-presentation] and [Vue.js (see presentation about that one too)][vuejs-presentation]. When using Wordpress, I use the lovely [Roots kit (see presentation)][roots-presentation]. When the site I'm building is small or if I'm doing prototyping work, [Jekyll][jekyllrb] is my go-to static-site generator. When designing, I prefer building real UIs through code, and I use [Sketch][sketchapp] for mocking them up.

## What I value most

* **I value being <mark>intentional and thorough,</mark> getting to the bottom of things and doing the right thing.** Going deep brings joy.
* **I value <mark>starting small, iterating,</mark> doing what matters, betting on the long-haul and respecting the natural rhythm of things.** Instead of taking a big ambitious bite out of life, why not bet on what will always be true, like the power of compound interest and doing stuff that's a little scary but at your level?
* **In relationships, I value <mark>authenticity, complicity,</mark> openness and truth.** Open up. It's scary but it matters. 
* **And I value <mark>improving myself</mark> and making a good environment for others to grow in.** Stepping on some toes? Better to step on your own first.

## [A blog on modern Christianity][faithblog]

In this care for growth and relationships and depth, I continue to be drawn to Christianity. Although deeply skeptical, I joyfully believe. Learning to bridge modernity and faith has been good for me, and so I write a blog on [Leading a modern life while living the Gospel][faithblog], sharing the ways for achieving both, fully. Let's grow towards more maturity, and to a more subtle faith.

Here are a few articles from the blog:

* [Surviving a crisis of faith and living the Gospel fully](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-04-surviving-a-crisis-of-faith/)
* [God, cocreator](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-06-god-cocreator/)
* [Away from the family](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-08-away-from-the-family/)
* [Go deep in everything](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-12-go-deep-in-everything/)
* [Free your beliefs](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2015-04-free-your-beliefs/)

*Lecteurs français: le blogue est également disponible en français. De plus, j'ai créé le site **[lectures.page][lectures]**, offrant les lectures du dimanche qui vient du missel romain (textes de l'[AELF][aelf]), utile pour une lecture personnelle ou pour des partages bibliques de groupe.*

## In closing, <span class="sub-title">two questions I think are helpful</span>

These questions help me stay true, and they help me make good choices. I hope they're useful to you too:

1. **What am I so convinced of?** Any time I feel conflicted, agitated, or that my options are limited, I inspect and identify my [mental models, those invisible lenses through which we distort how we see reality][mentalmodels]. I make it a habit to put my finger on my mental models, so I drive them and they don't drive me. Every time I did this, I was able to solve the right problem, build the right thing, and help people in the way they needed the help. And the second question is:
2. **What will I be celebrating?** Instead of writing lists of things to do, or of things I want to achieve, I write lists of things I'll *have achieved* in a future place in time. I call these [have-done lists][havedonelists]. That subtle change of position helps me visualize what's essential, what's central and what to ship first, and also what's a distraction and what to ignore until after that date. To write these lists, I use [Taskmator for iOS][taskmator] and [Taskpaper for Mac][taskpaper] with a [custom stylesheet][theme-notes-first].

Hope they help.
