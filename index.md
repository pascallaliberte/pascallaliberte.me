Hello, I'm Pascal Laliberté.
{: .home-intro }

## My main job and my sideline

Learn.med is the Faculty of Medicine's online learning platform. It offers online courses to practicing physicians, medical residents, and students of the MD program. We use xAPI to power our learning analytics and we've built a simple LMS to house our courses.

I also offer a service called Popup LMS. It's a simple way to get a few courses and quizzes online, and get detailed and customized reports on the progress of your learners.

## I like to think deeply, doing the right things...

I value depth of thought, intention, getting to the bottom of things and doing the right thing.

I value starting small, iterating, doing what matters, betting on the long-haul and respecting the natural rhythm of things.

In relationships, I value authenticity, complicity, openness and truth.

And I value surpassing myself, taking the lead and tending to others.

## I write a blog on modern Christianity

In this care for growth and relationships and depth, I'm drawn to Christianity. Deeply skeptical, I believe. Learning to bridge modernity and faith has been good for me, and I believe there's no higher urgency for my fellow christians to do the same. And so I write a blog on [Leading a modern life while living the Gospel][faithblog], sharing the ways I see in achieving both, fully. Let's all grow towards more maturity, and to a more subtle faith. Here's the list of articles:

## Maybe these questions will be helpful

Before you go, here are some questions for you. I pose myself these questions regularly, which help me stay true, and help me make good choices. I hope they're useful to you too:

* What are you so convinced of? Any time you feel conflicted, agitated, or out of options, inspect and identify your [mental models, those invisible lenses through which we distort how we see reality][mentalmodels]. Make it a habit to put your finger on them.
* What are you going to be celebrating? Before a date not too far into the future, what's the one thing you will be able to say you'll have done, and none of the others, to be celebrating? And then what would be the second from that list, and the third. I call these [have-done lists][havedonelists], and I find these essential to giving my best decisions my best shot.
