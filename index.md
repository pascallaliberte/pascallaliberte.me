## A Course on Writing Objectives

I'm offering a course on how to write objectives called [The Objectives Course][course]. The course will be especially useful if your bigger vision or ideals are competing with many smaller things you also care about. Limited spots for the group starting May 7. [Apply by Monday May 1][course].

## Areas of interest

My main areas of interest are:

* User Experience Design and Development
* The *Jobs-To-Be-Done* theory, which is on what causes people to purchase a product and helping companies sharpen their product offering ([I gave a talk on April 7 on the topic][jtbd-presentation]);
* Personal development coaching

[jtbd-presentation]: /jtbd/io/

**When building products, I use these technologies:** I've been doing work with [Vue.js][vuejs] for crafting web interfaces. When using Wordpress, I use the [Roots][rootsio] kits, but I prefer building sites using [Jekyll][jekyllrb], a static site generator. When designing, I prefer building real UIs through code, and I use [Sketch][sketchapp] for mocking them up.

## Previous work

Up until February, I was at [FarmLead][farmlead], a marketplace for farmers to sell their grain. My role was in leading the design (Web, Android, iOS) and in building the web app.

Previously, it's at the University of Ottawa that I helped bring user-centered design thinking, working on the web templates, and designing apps and web sites. At its Faculty of Medicine, I helped direct the creation of [Learn.med][learnmed], an online learning platform.

## Some of my beliefs

* Design is best when done in tandem with the implementation. Knowing the limits of the material you work with makes for a better design.
* There's a particular urgency to [surpass ourselves and to become mature about our choices][postheroism], so that we know how to handle the fast pace of life.
* Most times when we hit an either/or mindset, there's usually a third way.
* We're complicated people, and we're full of paradoxes. Learning to [bridge those paradoxes helps us be better with others][bridgeparadoxes].
* There's a way to [achieve multiple things at once][godeepineverything], so long as you ruthlessly put things in the right order. That way, the first thing will feed into the second one and into the third, and all the way down, letting you achieve them all.
* To-do lists are only a little helpful, because they're usually written as wish-for lists. I found that [writing will-have-done lists][willhavedone] to be the most helpful kind of list to write.

## What I value most

* In relationships, I value <mark>authenticity, complicity</mark>, openness and truth.
* And I value <mark>improving myself</mark> and making a good environment for others to grow in.

## A blog on modern Christianity

In this care for growth and relationships and depth, I continue to be drawn to Christianity. Although deeply skeptical, I joyfully believe. Learning to bridge modernity and faith has been good for me, and so I write a blog on [Leading a modern life while living the Gospel][faithblog], sharing the ways for achieving both, fully. Let's grow towards more maturity, and to a more subtle faith.

Here are a few articles from the blog:

* [Surviving a crisis of faith and living the Gospel fully](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-04-surviving-a-crisis-of-faith/)
* [God, cocreator](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-06-god-cocreator/)
* [Away from the family](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-08-away-from-the-family/)
* [Go deep in everything](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-12-go-deep-in-everything/)
* [Free your beliefs](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2015-04-free-your-beliefs/)

## In closing, two questions I think are helpful

These questions help me stay true, and they help me make good choices. I hope they're useful to you too:

1. **What am I so convinced of?** Any time I feel conflicted, agitated, or that my options are limited, I inspect and identify my [mental models, those invisible lenses through which we distort how we see reality][mentalmodels]. I make it a habit to put my finger on my mental models, so I drive them and they don't drive me. Every time I did this, I was able to solve the right problem, build the right thing, and help people in the way they needed the help. And the second question is:
2. **What will I be celebrating?** Instead of writing lists of things to do, or of things I want to achieve, I write lists of things I'll *have achieved* in a future place in time. I call these [will-have-done lists][havedonelists]. That subtle change of position helps me visualize what's essential, what's central and what to ship first, and also what's a distraction and what to ignore until after that date. To write these lists, I use [Taskmator for iOS][taskmator] and [Taskpaper for Mac][taskpaper] with a [custom stylesheet][theme-notes-first].

Hope they help.
