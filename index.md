## [The Language of Objectives][language-of-objectives] <span class="sub-title">Catch-up on the small so you can get to your bigger priorities</span>

I'm offering a course called [The Language of Objectives][language-of-objectives]. It teaches thinking tools (centered on a novel way to write objectives called _have-done lists_) to help you get a handle on the trivial stuff so you can finally get to those bigger things. {% if site.course.allow_signups %} There are limited spots for the group starting {{ site.course.starts }}. [Apply by {{ site.course.deadline }}][language-of-objectives].{% else %}[Learn more][language-of-objectives]{% endif %}

I'm offering [a tweaking service to make your Shopify Store faster to load and more up to date](/bleep-bloop-shop/). (Why Bleep, Bloop? That's the sounds our internet connections make here in Canada. jk, jk)

## My work <span class="sub-title">Personal Development, Product Marketing and Web UIs</span>

I'm currently preparing a way to help product owners improve their sales by tweaking how they present their product. By understanding the _reason_ why someone bought your product (they wanted progress in that area of their life), you can craft your messaging. To be notified when I announce that service, here's where to sign-up:

## Previous work

Up until February, I was at [FarmLead][farmlead], a marketplace for farmers to sell their grain. My role was in leading the design (Web, Android, iOS) and in building the web app.

Previously, it's at the University of Ottawa that I helped bring user-centered design thinking, working on the web templates, and designing apps and web sites. At its Faculty of Medicine, I helped direct the creation of [Learn.med][learnmed], an online learning platform.
</div>

<div class="scroll-reveal" markdown="1" id="beliefs">
## Some of my beliefs

* Design is best when done in tandem with the implementation. Knowing the limits of the material you work with makes for a better design.
* There's a particular urgency to [surpass ourselves and to become mature about our choices][postheroism], so that we know how to handle the fast pace of life.
* Most times when we hit an either/or mindset, there's usually a third way.
* We're complicated people, and we're full of paradoxes. Learning to [bridge those paradoxes helps us be better with others][bridgeparadoxes].
* There's a way to [achieve multiple things at once][godeepineverything], so long as you ruthlessly put things in the right order. That way, the first thing will feed into the second one and into the third, and all the way down, letting you achieve them all.
* To-do lists are only a little helpful, because they're usually written as wish-for lists. I found that [writing will-have-done lists][willhavedone] to be the most helpful kind of list to write.

## Areas of interest

My main areas of interest are:

* The *Jobs-To-Be-Done* theory, which is on what causes people to purchase a product. [I gave a talk on May 25 on the Jobs-To-Be-Done theory][jtbd-presentation];
* Personal development coaching

[jtbd-presentation]: /jtbd/hub/

**When building products, I use these technologies:** I've been doing work with [Vue.js][vuejs] for crafting web interfaces. When using Wordpress, I use the [Roots][rootsio] kits (see my [presentation on Roots at Wordpress Ottawa][roots-presentation]). When the site I'm building is small or if I'm doing prototyping work, [Jekyll][jekyllrb] is my go-to static-site generator. When designing, I prefer building real UIs through code, and I use [Sketch][sketchapp] for mocking them up.

## [A blog on modern Christianity][faithblog]

In this care for growth and relationships and depth, I continue to be drawn to Christianity. Although deeply skeptical, I joyfully believe. Learning to bridge modernity and faith has been good for me, and so I write a blog on [Leading a modern life while living the Gospel][faithblog], sharing the ways for achieving both, fully. Let's grow towards more maturity, and to a more subtle faith.

Here are a few articles from the blog:

* [Surviving a crisis of faith and living the Gospel fully](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-04-surviving-a-crisis-of-faith/)
* [God, cocreator](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-06-god-cocreator/)
* [Away from the family](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-08-away-from-the-family/)
* [Go deep in everything](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-12-go-deep-in-everything/)
* [Free your beliefs](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2015-04-free-your-beliefs/)

<div class="scroll-reveal" markdown="1" id="questions">
## In closing, <span class="sub-title">two questions I think are helpful</span>

These questions help me stay true, and they help me make good choices. I hope they're useful to you too:

1. **What am I so convinced of?** Any time I feel conflicted, agitated, or that my options are limited, I inspect and identify my [mental models, those invisible lenses through which we distort how we see reality][mentalmodels]. I make it a habit to put my finger on my mental models, so I drive them and they don't drive me. Every time I did this, I was able to solve the right problem, build the right thing, and help people in the way they needed the help. And the second question is:
2. **What will I be celebrating?** Instead of writing lists of things to do, or of things I want to achieve, I write lists of things I'll *have achieved* in a future place in time. I call these [have-done lists][havedonelists]. That subtle change of position helps me visualize what's essential, what's central and what to ship first, and also what's a distraction and what to ignore until after that date. To write these lists, I use [Taskmator for iOS][taskmator] and [Taskpaper for Mac][taskpaper] with a [custom stylesheet][theme-notes-first].

Hope they help.
