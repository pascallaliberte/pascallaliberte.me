## Previous work

Before my move to freelancing I was at the startup called [FarmLead][farmlead], a marketplace for farmers to sell their grain. My role was in leading a re-design of the application (Web, Android, iOS) and in re-writing the web app.

Before that, I worked at the University of Ottawa. I helped bring user-centered design thinking. I did that by supporting the web development community by giving talks, by building tools like the central web templates and by writing documentation. I also built apps and web sites there too. In the last years, I was at the Faculty of Medicine where I directed the creation of [Learn.med][learnmed], an online learning platform.

<div class="scroll-reveal" markdown="1" id="beliefs">
## Some of my beliefs

* Design is best when done in tandem with the implementation. Knowing the limits of the material you work with makes for a better design.
* There's a particular urgency to [surpass ourselves and to become mature about our choices][postheroism], so that we know how to handle the fast pace of life.
* Most times when we hit an either/or mindset, there's usually a third way.
* We're complicated people, and we're full of paradoxes. Learning to [bridge those paradoxes helps us be better with others][bridgeparadoxes].
* There's a way to [achieve multiple things at once][godeepineverything], so long as you ruthlessly put things in the right order. That way, the first thing will feed into the second one and into the third, and all the way down, letting you achieve them all.
* To-do lists are only a little helpful, because they're usually written as wish-for lists. I found that [writing have-done lists][havedone] to be the most helpful kind of list to write.

## Areas of interest

My main areas of interest are:

* The *Jobs-To-Be-Done* theory, which is on what causes people to purchase a product. [I gave a talk on May 25 on the Jobs-To-Be-Done theory][jtbd-presentation];
* Personal development coaching

[jtbd-presentation]: /jtbd/hub/

**When building products, I use these technologies:** For crafting web interfaces, I've been really liking [Stimulus (see a presentation I gave)][stimulusjs-presentation] and [Vue.js (see presentation about that one too)][vuejs-presentation]. When using Wordpress, I use the lovely [Roots kit (see presentation)][roots-presentation]. When the site I'm building is small or if I'm doing prototyping work, [Jekyll][jekyllrb] is my go-to static-site generator. When designing, I prefer building real UIs through code, and I use [Sketch][sketchapp] for mocking them up.

## What I value most

* **I value being <mark>intentional and thorough,</mark> getting to the bottom of things and doing the right thing.** Going deep brings joy.
* **I value <mark>starting small, iterating,</mark> doing what matters, betting on the long-haul and respecting the natural rhythm of things.** Instead of taking a big ambitious bite out of life, why not bet on what will always be true, like the power of compound interest and doing stuff that's a little scary but at your level?
* **In relationships, I value <mark>authenticity, complicity,</mark> openness and truth.** Open up. It's scary but it matters. 
* **And I value <mark>improving myself</mark> and making a good environment for others to grow in.** Stepping on some toes? Better to step on your own first.

<div class="scroll-reveal" markdown="1" id="christianity">
## [A blog on modern Christianity][faithblog]

In this care for growth and relationships and depth, I continue to be drawn to Christianity. Although deeply skeptical, I joyfully believe. Learning to bridge modernity and faith has been good for me, and so I write a blog on [Leading a modern life while living the Gospel][faithblog], sharing the ways for achieving both, fully. Let's grow towards more maturity, and to a more subtle faith.

Here are a few articles from the blog:

* [Surviving a crisis of faith and living the Gospel fully](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-04-surviving-a-crisis-of-faith/)
* [God, cocreator](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-06-god-cocreator/)
* [Away from the family](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-08-away-from-the-family/)
* [Go deep in everything](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-12-go-deep-in-everything/)
* [Free your beliefs](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2015-04-free-your-beliefs/)

*Lecteurs français: le blogue est également disponible en français. De plus, j'ai créé le site **[lectures.page][lectures]**, offrant les lectures du dimanche qui vient du missel romain (textes de l'[AELF][aelf]), utile pour une lecture personnelle ou pour des partages bibliques de groupe.*

<div class="scroll-reveal" markdown="1" id="questions">
## In closing, <span class="sub-title">two questions I think are helpful</span>

These questions help me stay true, and they help me make good choices. I hope they're useful to you too:

1. **What am I so convinced of?** Any time I feel conflicted, agitated, or that my options are limited, I inspect and identify my [mental models, those invisible lenses through which we distort how we see reality][mentalmodels]. I make it a habit to put my finger on my mental models, so I drive them and they don't drive me. Every time I did this, I was able to solve the right problem, build the right thing, and help people in the way they needed the help. And the second question is:
2. **What will I be celebrating?** Instead of writing lists of things to do, or of things I want to achieve, I write lists of things I'll *have achieved* in a future place in time. I call these [have-done lists][havedonelists]. That subtle change of position helps me visualize what's essential, what's central and what to ship first, and also what's a distraction and what to ignore until after that date. To write these lists, I use [Taskmator for iOS][taskmator] and [Taskpaper for Mac][taskpaper] with a [custom stylesheet][theme-notes-first].

Hope they help.
