Hi, I'm Pascal Laliberté. Thanks for dropping by.

## My work: University of Ottawa and Popup LMS

[Learn.med][learnmed] is the online learning platform for the University of Ottawa's Faculty of Medicine. It offers online courses to practicing physicians, medical residents, and students of the MD program. We use xAPI to power our learning analytics and we've built a simple LMS to house our courses. I think what we've done is pretty neat.

On the side, I also offer a service called [Popup LMS][popuplms]. It's a simple way to get a few courses and quizzes online, and get detailed and customized reports on the progress of your learners. If you're looking to take a break from a Learning Managements System you don't love, I can help you to run your course for a few months in a place that's simple, clear, and worry-free. [Check it out][popuplms].

*In what I do, I care first about the person using the product. Everything, to me, is about doing what's right for the user. If that's central to how you work too, [let's chat][twitter].*

## I'm kind of a deep guy. Here's what I value the most

I value being intentional and thorough, getting to the bottom of things and doing the right thing.

I value starting small, iterating, doing what matters, betting on the long-haul and respecting the natural rhythm of things.

In relationships, I value authenticity, complicity, openness and truth.

And I value surpassing myself, taking the lead and tending to others.

*What are some of your values? [I'd love to know!][twitter]*

## A blog on modern Christianity

In this care for growth and relationships and depth, I continue to be drawn to Christianity. Although deeply skeptical, I believe. Learning to bridge modernity and faith has been good for me, and so I write a blog on [Leading a modern life while living the Gospel][faithblog], sharing the ways for achieving both, fully. Let's grow towards more maturity, and to a more subtle faith.

Here are a few articles from the blog:

* [Surviving a crisis of faith and living the Gospel fully](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-04-surviving-a-crisis-of-faith/)
* [God, cocreator](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-06-god-cocreator/)
* [Away from the family](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-08-away-from-the-family/)
* [Go deep in everything](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-12-go-deep-in-everything/)
* [Free your beliefs](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2015-04-free-your-beliefs/)

## In closing, two questions I think are helpful

These questions help me stay true, and they help me make good choices. I hope they're useful to you too:

1. **What am I so convinced of?** Any time I feel conflicted, agitated, or that my options are limited, I inspect and identify my [mental models, those invisible lenses through which we distort how we see reality][mentalmodels]. I make it a habit to put my finger on my mental models, so I drive them and they don't drive me. Every time I did this, I was able to solve the right problem, build the right thing, and help people in the way they needed the help.
2. **What will I be celebrating?** Instead of writing lists of things to do, or of things I want to achieve, I write lists of things I'll *have achieved* in a future place in time. I call these [will-have-done lists][havedonelists]. That subtle change of position helps me visualize what's essential, what's central and what to ship first, and also what's a distraction and what to ignore until after that date.

So yeah, mental models and will-have-done lists. Hope they help.
