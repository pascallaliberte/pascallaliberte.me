Hi, I'm Pascal Laliberté. Thanks for dropping by.

## My work: User Interface Designer and Developer

My whole career, I've been improving user interfaces and shaping the conditions for good design to happen.

Most recently, I've joined the team at [FarmLead][farmlead], a marketplace for farmers to sell their grain, where I'm evolving the design of their product and apps.

Previously, it's at the University of Ottawa that I helped bring design thinking, working on the central web and templates, and designing apps and web sites. At its Faculty of Medicine, I helped direct the creation of [Learn.med][learnmed], an online learning platform.

[learnmed]: https://learn.med.uottawa.ca/

Since the start, I've had my hand in both design and implementation. I believe that each one informs the other, for better, more integrated designs.

## Some of my beliefs

* There's no greater urgency to [become mature about our choices and to be helpful][postheroism].
* Most times when we hit an either/or mindset, there's usually a third way.
* We're complicated people, full of paradoxes. Learning to [bridge those paradoxes helps us be better with others][bridgeparadoxes].
* There's a way to be profoundly pro-technology and also require it to be centered on the person.
* It's possible to [go deep in ten things at once][godeepineverything], you just have to know what to put as the central thing and to put the rest of the list in order. One will feed into the other, letting you achieve them all.
* To-do lists are only a little helpful, because they're usually written as wish-for lists. I found that [writing will-have-done lists][willhavedone] to be the most helpful kind of list to write.

## What I value the most

* I value being <mark>intentional and thorough</mark>, getting to the bottom of things and doing the right thing.
* I value <mark>starting small, iterating</mark>, doing what matters, betting on the long-haul and respecting the natural rhythm of things.
* In relationships, I value <mark>authenticity, complicity</mark>, openness and truth.
* And I value <mark>improving myself</mark> and making a good environment for others to grow in.

## A blog on modern Christianity

In this care for growth and relationships and depth, I continue to be drawn to Christianity. Although deeply skeptical, I joyfully believe. Learning to bridge modernity and faith has been good for me, and so I write a blog on [Leading a modern life while living the Gospel][faithblog], sharing the ways for achieving both, fully. Let's grow towards more maturity, and to a more subtle faith.

Here are a few articles from the blog:

* [Surviving a crisis of faith and living the Gospel fully](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-04-surviving-a-crisis-of-faith/)
* [God, cocreator](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-06-god-cocreator/)
* [Away from the family](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-08-away-from-the-family/)
* [Go deep in everything](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2014-12-go-deep-in-everything/)
* [Free your beliefs](http://by.pascallaliberte.me/2015-04-free-your-beliefs/)

## In closing, two questions I think are helpful

These questions help me stay true, and they help me make good choices. I hope they're useful to you too:

1. **What am I so convinced of?** Any time I feel conflicted, agitated, or that my options are limited, I inspect and identify my [mental models, those invisible lenses through which we distort how we see reality][mentalmodels]. I make it a habit to put my finger on my mental models, so I drive them and they don't drive me. Every time I did this, I was able to solve the right problem, build the right thing, and help people in the way they needed the help. And the second question is:
2. **What will I be celebrating?** Instead of writing lists of things to do, or of things I want to achieve, I write lists of things I'll *have achieved* in a future place in time. I call these [will-have-done lists][havedonelists]. That subtle change of position helps me visualize what's essential, what's central and what to ship first, and also what's a distraction and what to ignore until after that date.

Hope they help.
