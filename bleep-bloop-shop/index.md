# The Speed Tweak

On slow mobile connections, or in slow data zones, your Shopify Store might be loading too slowly for your visitors. They tap to your site, wait a bit, it's too slow for them, and they go back. [Lost sale][lost-sales].

A slow-loading site will also [affect your search rankings][search-rankings].

## Some of the things you'd have to do to fix it:

* **Simulate the site loading at slow speeds**: there's going to be the first screenful. You want that to quickly answer the questions "Am I at the right spot?" and "Is it worth the wait?"
* **See where the hiccups are** by breaking down the loading sequence.
* **Handle that first high-quality image**: display a fast-loading, pertinent graphic while it loads. An `.svg` image that looks like the outlines of the real image, or a centered sharp logo atop a blurry (at first) image.
* **Delay everything you can until later**: images that are further below: they can wait until we're closer to them to load them. Any javascript files that are needed just for one page: don't make it a requirement for the all pages.
* **Reduce the size of images to be faster** to load at a similar quality level.
* **Reward those who stuck with the first page with really quick subsequent taps or clicks**: if each tap is a drag, bye-bye. If each tap is quick, your buyer's free to move about and do business.

### Q. How come Shopify doesn't provide themes made for this?

Shopify already does a lot to help with speed. They host your images (and styles and scripts) on servers around the world (via a CDN) for fast speeds. They provide an easy way to serve just the right image for the device. Its themes are built for the balance between speed and good looks. And Shopify also gives tips on how to improve your page-loading speed, but for those, the ball's in your court.
