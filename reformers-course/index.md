# The Reformer's Course <span class="tagline">Train your mind to be sharp for when you're the one to make those changes happen</span>
{: #course-title }

(Coming soon) by [Pascal Lalibert√©](/)
{: .byline }

To you, there are changes that need to be made. Maybe it's in your workplace, maybe it's in your family, or maybe it's in your surroundings.

Maybe those changes are small, maybe they're subtle. Maybe they're complex, and maybe they're intimidating.

But they're important.

If you're serious about making those changes happen, you don't want your mind to be the thing that's in the way.

Train your mind to be at its sharpest. No ego, no fumbles, no conceit, no bias. Just the best version of you, to serve the situation in front of you and to make it better.

## More about the course

The course will teach you techniques to list your thoughts and rewrite them. Over 15 lessons, we'll look at situations from different people who see a change that needs to be made, who prepare themselves, and make it happen.

* One person **prepares a conversation** with her supervisor for proposing a change in the way things are done.
* One person creates a difficult but important document to **sell an idea**.
* Another person **redefines a relationship with a co-worker in a deep way**, and creates a partnership that's going to be key to doing the next big thing.
* A person makes a **tiny change in their posture** ahead of talking to the group, and the impact is remarked by others.
* Another person was asked to do something consequential and important, but is **paralyzed with doubt** about her capabilities.
* Another person is **furious about the work of a team member**, and she prepares for the best way to make this into a good situation for both of you (and others).
* One person sees that a **change in the team's processes** is important, and she envisions the next month and her approach to bring that new approach in.
* A person senses some **cynicism installing itself** in the mind of people of the group. She knows the cause, and she feels urged to fix it before it gets out of hand.
* Another person is reading about change management, but realizes the biggest impact she can have, is to **be a person people can be comfortable being authentic to**.

**<mark markdown="1">All these people are reformers.</mark>** They're not just implementors. They're not creating something big to be seen by all. They're not founding a new company. They just pose the right action at the right time. They lead with a mixture of heart, fragility, and unexpected confidence.

If you'd like to be better at doing those things, I hope you'll make the jump.
