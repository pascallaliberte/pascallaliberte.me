# The Reformer's Course <span class="tagline">When you're the one to make that change happen</span>
{: #course-title }

by [Pascal Lalibert√©](/)
{: .byline }

When you see that things could be done better.  
When cynicism is starting to settle in a little too much.  
When there's a game being played, and it's not the right game.  
When you think you got a plan that could make the difference.  
When, no matter what, you're better off trying.  
When there's an opportunity to have things changed.  

And when you want to be ready for it.

**It's said that there aren't enough reformers.** There are implementors, which to you isn't a satisfying role to have. There are founders, which interests you slightly, but isn't the move you want to make right now. And much more practically, there are reformers (or not enough of them), those who look at the world as it is and push it a little further than anyone thought was practical.

So what's missing? Most of what you need, you already have. You insist on getting to the bottom of things, you aim to do the right thing, you inventory every variable, and you see all of what's wrong.

Maybe seeing all of the variables is a burden for you. Caring about everything is a drag. Wanting to go deep on stuff means you can't go deep on everything. And so you stay on the surface, and you play the game everybody else is playing, to your regret.

You have an urge to fix broken things, from systems to processes to relationships. To you, it's all the same. It all needs fixing. You've tried saying the job is for someone else, but this time, it seems to be your turn.

For you, I'm putting together The Reformer's Course.

## The two techniques the course teaches:

To help you take that step (and many other steps after that), there are two main techniques this course teaches:

**Have-Done Lists**, and **Mental Models**.

This video shows you how they work (38 minutes):

## You can use these techniques for doing the following:

* **Taking inventory of everything that's on your mind**, and going deep on everything you want to go deep in, no compromise. You'll do that by using a way to list everything, and re-write your relationship to each of them with more subtlety, fewer absolutes, and more relativity. Have-done lists will be what you'll use for this (more on that below).
* **Catching yourself when you're in a reactionary state** (you know, when you're feeling obsessed with a single way forward) and re-wire your thoughts to see more clearly. You'll do that by practicing seeing something that's normally invisible to your brain: its own mental models (more on that below as well).
* **Moving away from doing small things to doing big things instead.** You'll do that by envisioning the future you think is important to go towards. Just by rewriting statements describing the future, you'll be taken by a sense of "this is so obvious, it has to happen". And then you'll go out and do it. And when you catch some thoughts coming up, as anything of consequence normally creates, you'll know how to deal with them. Both have-done lists and mental models are what you'll use for this.

## More on how these two techniques work:

[**Have-done lists**][have-done-lists] are lists of statements describing what you will have done by a certain time in the future. This single approach replaces both to-do lists and goal-setting at the same time, and it works for big timelines (bigger goals) and well as small timelines (shorter-term to-dos).

Start with a heading with this format: "By *&lt;time or event in the future&gt;*, I'll have". Then, underneath, write statements that start with a past participle verb, finishing the sentence started by the heading. e.g. "By the end of the week, I'll have:" "Finished the minimum things I need to have done", "Prepared a first draft of a proposal to send to my supervisor".

The technique becomes particularly powerful when there are a lot of statements, and you're forced to choose what goes to the top. You need to rewrite statements to find the variants that sound _the most true_, group them under one another, and using a mix of logic and intuition, you devise a list that describes _perfectly_ your intention.

What's more, this approach creates lists that are surprisingly flexible to changes. There are several questions you can ask yourself to help you get have-done lists that are super helpful, and we'll go over these questions in the course.

[**Mental Models**][mental-models] are these invisible lenses that our brain uses to color our perception of the world (biases, conclusions, oppositions, labels, prejudices, certainties). Since our brain stores facts together _with the conclusion it made about the fact_, it makes it difficult for us to see things clearly.

Seeing your mental models is a way for you to be objective. But objectivity is the first thing that goes out the window when you're in a moment of certainty, or in a moment of feeling annoyed or misunderstood or confronted or defensive. You regain objectivity after that moment is gone, but it was in that moment that your objectivity was needed.

In the course, you'll train the habit of spotting mental models _as they take over_. It's not easy, but boy is it useful. It'll turn you into one of the most effective leaders, because you'll serve the situation and the people around you with agility and poise.

## Here's how the course works:

**There are 15 lessons**, and each lesson starts from a situation that some example person is going through, and in which she applies have-done lists and mental models to turn it around and make it better.

<div class="examples" markdown="1">
### Examples:

One person is preparing for a talk with his boss.  
One person is preparing a difficult conversation with a partner in other group.  
Another person was asked to do something consequential and important, but is paralyzed with doubt about her capabilities.  
Another person is furious about the work of a team member, and she prepares for the best way to make this into a good situation for both of you (and others).  
Another person prepares a presentation that could have a huge impact.

In addition to the lessons, there will be a way for you to learn from others taking the course. Not a forum or a chat room, something different, which I think is better.
